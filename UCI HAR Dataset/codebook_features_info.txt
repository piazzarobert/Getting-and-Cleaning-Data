  Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the Accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcceleration-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the Acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity Acceleration signals (tBodyAcceleration-XYZ and tGravityAcceleration-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear Acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccelerationMagnitude, tGravityAccelerationMagnitude, tBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude, tBodyGyroMagnitude, tBodyGyroJerkMagnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcceleration-XYZ, fBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude, fBodyGyroMagnitude, fBodyGyroJerkMagnitude. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
